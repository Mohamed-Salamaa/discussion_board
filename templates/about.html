            Welcome to <strong>Discussion Board</strong> — a simple, powerful platform built to bring people together
            for meaningful conversations. Our app helps communities, teams, and individuals create topic-focused boards
            where members can post questions, share insights, and engage in threaded discussions.

          <h5 class="mt-3">Why we built it</h5>
          <p>
            We believe that open, well-organized discussion is one of the best ways to learn and collaborate.
            Discussion Board makes it easy to structure conversations so knowledge is discoverable and every voice
            can contribute.
